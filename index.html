		<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<p>We employ tax assessor data to forecast evictions in San
		Francisco. Using the proximate measure of eviction notices
		filed with the San Francisco Rent Board, we train a machine
		learning model to predict the likelihood of a filing on a given
		block in the city. The dataset analyzed includes a wide range
		of containing property characteristics, ownership informa-
		tion, and tax payment history of land parcels aggregated
		at the block level We investigate the usefulness of spatial
		features for this task. We compute averages of our tax data
		across neighborhoods as well as metrics representing each
		blocks position in a spatial network. Identifying these factors
		can help us gain a better understanding of the relationship
		between property characteristics and eviction likelihood for
		further research or more effective policy. This in turn can
		lead to more stable and affordable housing options for resi-
		dents of San Francisco.</p>

		<h2>Project Results</h2>
		<p>For our prediction task, we tested our model with four differ-
		ent sets of features: tax features found in Table 1, neighbor-
		hood features computed by averaging values in Table 1 from
		each node’s neighborhood, graph features found in Table 2,
		and all features. 
		All models performed relatively similarly. Each had very
		high accuracy, able to predict nearly 90% of the time which
		blocks in the following year would have an eviction filing.
		However, the poor precision scores indicate the proportion
		of true positives of all predicted positives is low. Indeed, the
		poor recall scores indicate the model is failing to identify
		most of the positives.
		Eviction forecasting is a difficult task, depending of highly
		local and individual phenomena that is difficult for a sim-
		ple model with such limited data to predict. However, it
		appears that the marginal increase in f1 between the all fea-
		tures model and the tax data only model indicates moderate
		evidence for both of our hypotheses.
		To better understand how the features we computed con-
		tribute to our model’s predictive capacity, we can look into
		the weight given to each feature by our model. Given the
		architecture of the XGBoost classification model, we are
		defining weight as the number of times features are used to
		split the data across trees.
		In our all features model, we can immediately see the cause
		of our high accuracy compared to the low f1. The primary
		feature is the number of units on a block. Our model under-
		stands most evictions will happen where most residential
		units are. Next is the eviction filing count of neighboring
		blocks, followed by eigenvector centrality. Generally, our
		all features model gives greater weight to the neighborhood
		features than the block level features. This may be an indi-
		cation that the model can infer trends from patterns in the
		surrounding neighborhood.
		Our tax features model gives the greatest weight to the
		number of units as well, in addition to the land value and
		improvement value. This is followed by information about
		the structure such as number of rooms, property area, and
		number of bedrooms.
		In contrast, our neighborhood features model gives the
		greatest weight to the eviction count of neighbors, followed
		by features indicating commercial properties in the neigh-
		borhood.
		Lastly, our graph features model gives greatest weight
		eigenvector centrality, longitude, and latitude</p>
